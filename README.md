# LinearBayes3

A (simpler) `Python3` implementation of the Bayesian straight line fitting code
originally developed by [Angus Williams](https://github.com/anguswilliams91/LinearBayes),
based on the [Hogg, Bovy & Lang (2010)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686) article.

Requires `numpy`, `scipy`, [`emcee`](https://emcee.readthedocs.io). Optionally
requires `matplotlib` and [`corner.py`](https://corner.readthedocs.io) to plot
the test runs.
